# Postmortem: Checkout Page Outage

### Issue Summary
**Duration**:  
The outage occurred on *August 10, 2024, from 12:30 PM UTC to 1:00 PM UTC*, lasting for 30 minutes.

**Impact**:  
During the outage, our e-commerce platform's checkout page was unavailable, preventing approximately 40% of users from completing their transactions. Affected users experienced slow response times and were unable to load the checkout page. This resulted in a significant drop in sales during the affected period.

**Root Cause**:  
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer, which routed excessive traffic to one server, overwhelming its capacity and causing the checkout page to become unresponsive.

### Timeline
- **12:30 PM UTC**: The monitoring tool, Prometheus, detected a spike in response time on the checkout page.
- **12:32 PM UTC**: PagerDuty triggered an alert to the on-call engineer, notifying them of the degraded performance.
- **12:35 PM UTC**: Initial investigation began with the review of server logs and web server status.
- **12:40 PM UTC**: Misleading path: Suspected a network issue but found no problems after reviewing network diagnostics.
- **12:45 PM UTC**: Escalated to the infrastructure team to investigate potential server load balancing issues.
- **12:50 PM UTC**: The load balancer configuration was identified as the root cause.
- **12:55 PM UTC**: The configuration was corrected to distribute traffic evenly across all servers.
- **1:00 PM UTC**: The issue was resolved, and the system returned to normal performance.

### Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the outage was traced to a misconfigured load balancer that funneled excessive traffic to one server, causing it to reach its maximum capacity. This resulted in the checkout page becoming unresponsive for users attempting to complete their purchases.  

The resolution involved reconfiguring the load balancer to evenly distribute traffic across all servers. Once the changes were made, the affected server's load decreased, and normal functionality was restored.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
**Improvements/Fixes**:
- Improve monitoring to provide early warnings on uneven traffic distribution across servers.
- Conduct regular audits of load balancer configurations to ensure they remain optimal.
- Ensure better alert thresholds for high server load conditions.

**Actionable Tasks**:
1. Implement enhanced load monitoring to track individual server capacity in real-time.
2. Automate failover and load distribution in case of traffic spikes.
3. Schedule regular checks on load balancer configurations.
4. Review and update server scaling policies to handle sudden traffic increases more efficiently.
